In contrast to writing to PrintWriter, when reading from a BufferedReader you have to take exceptions
into account.
1. What would be the reason for this difference?
An exception will be thrown when you try to read something that isn't there, eg; end of file.

2. For a PrintWriter, how can you check whether output has succeeded?
Check if data has appeared in your destination.

3. How can you construct a BufferedReader based on standard input?
new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in));
