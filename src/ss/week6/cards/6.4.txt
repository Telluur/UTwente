1. How can you construct a PrintWriter or BufferedReader object that corresponds to a ﬁle on your
computer?
File file = new File("C:/file.txt");
PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file);
FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("C:/file.txt");
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);

2. What does it mean to ﬂush a Writer (see Writer.flush())?
from docs:
Flushes this stream by writing any buffered output to the underlying stream.

3. How can you make sure that after every call to println a PrintWriter is automatically ﬂushed?
Construct PrintWriter using:
PrintWriter(OutputStream out, boolean autoFlush);
eg;
new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File("parent","child")), true)
FileOutputStream is a direct subclass of OutputStream.
